## Humble Superhero Web App

The web app interface allows users to interact with a superhero database.

1. **View Superheroes:** Users can see a list of all superheroes stored in the backend.

2. **Add New Superheroes:** Users can add new superheroes by filling out a form with details such as the superhero's name, powers, and other relevant information.

## Start the Backend

Before starting the frontend, make sure the backend is running. The backend provides the API that handles the superhero data.

## Web Project setup
